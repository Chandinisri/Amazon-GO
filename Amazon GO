Amazon has been opening physical Amazon Go convenience stores and Amazon Go Grocery stores across the US and it has now launched a UK store, branded Amazon Fresh.

All have one thing in common - unlike most shops, there are no registers or cashiers. You walk in, pick out what you want, and walk out.
Amazon calls it a 'just walk out' shopping experience.
Amazon Go's checkout-free shopping experience is made possible by the same types of technologies used in self-driving cars and they are:
          1.    Computer Vision
          2.    Sensor Fusion
          3.    Deep Learning
